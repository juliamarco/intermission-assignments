## How The Web Works

### Background:

Review the materials below.

* First let's read [MDN HOW WEB WORKS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
* Next let's watch a few quick examples of [how the internet works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc).
* And [how IP addresses work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFooN7Mu0IM   - how IP addresses work).
* Finally let's tie these things together and watch a video about [DNS - what happens when you type an address into a web browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA).
* Lastly, let's read a little about [the anatomy of a URL](https://doepud.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-url)

### Questions:

Now we have a better grasp about the internet, and how some of the things are working. Now, let's answer a few questions to check our understanding. Don't be afraid to do additional research (googleing) for an answer. Fork this gist and answer the following questions:

1. Describe, step by step, what happens when I type `www.example.com` into my browser and try to go to the page?

 First the browser checks its cache, as it  maintains a repository of DNS records for a fixed duration for websites you have previously visited. It also checks the Operating system, the router and the ISP cache. 
 If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISPâ€™s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address. Once the browser receives the correct IP address it will build a connection with the server that matches IP address to transfer information.
 Then the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server and the server handles the request and sends back a response. The server response contains a representation of the web page you requested (HTML content), that the browser will display.
